class Name : PatternSyntaxChecker.java
Using Regex, we can easily match or search for patterns in a text. Before searching for a pattern, we have to specify one using some well-defined syntax.

In this problem, you are given a pattern. You have to check whether the syntax of the given pattern is valid.

Note: In this problem, a regex is only valid if you can compile it using the Pattern.compile method.
